The **C**oastlines and people **O**pen data and **M**achin**E** learning sprin**T**  is an event where participants focus on doing data-driven 'Coastlines and People' science for 72hrs. 

Participants apply to be part of each event, where tehy presetn ideas to fellow participants, break into groups, and focus on rapidly produing an Open Science product. Our intention is for participants to use open data to make these open Science advances. We ask that all code written at the event will be open source, put on github, and given a DOI. A fianl 'report out' will allow each group to present what they accomplished at the end of teh 72 hours, and groups will also submit a report/working apper to the EarthArXiv preprint server. Our intention is for these open deliverables to be the seeds of future research.

At each event we aim to develop collaborative networks of researchers working at the intersection of Coastlines and People who are interested in data-driven projects.

Coming soon... Basic Event structure
